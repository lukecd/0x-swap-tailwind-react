This project started out as the 9th week of the (excellent) Road To Web 3 tutorial series from Alchemy.

The tutorial was to build a swap app using tools from 0x.org.

The tutorial used Vanilla JavaScript, CSS and web3.js to build things out. Lately I've been teaching myself React, RainbowKit (which users ethers.js) and Tailwind ... So I thought a fun challenge would be to follow along in the tutorial, and then translate things over from Vanilla JS / CSS => React / RainbowKit / Tailwind.
