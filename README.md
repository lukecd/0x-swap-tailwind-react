This project started out as the 9th week of the (excellent) Road To Web 3 tutorial series from Alchemy.

The tutorial was to build a swap app using tools from 0x.org.

The tutorial used Vanilla JavaScript, CSS and web3.js to build things out. Lately I've been teaching myself React, RainbowKit (which uses ethers.js) and Tailwind ... So I thought a fun challenge would be to follow along in the tutorial, and then translate things over from Vanilla JS / CSS => React / RainbowKit / Tailwind. 

Lately about different ways to communicate with the user, ideas besides just using modal dialogs. For this project I first imagined a DEX with an ocean theme, a way to play off the "crypto whale" metaphor. I thought it would be cool to have a background of waves that subtly undulate, barely perceptible motion ... except when a transaction is being processed in which case they speed up a lot.

In order to let people test things out without spending money, you can click "Approve" to speed up the waves, and then just click "Reject tranaction" when MetaMask appears. I added a link for demo purposes you can click to slow the waves back down. In a production environment, the waves would automatically slow when the transaction finished. 

I just finished two projects that used p5.js to do some animation, and then right  as I finished them, I read that working directly with the HTML Canvas can be more efficient. So I googled "how to draw sine curves in HMTL Canvas" and found this very very helpful tuorial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLfhY4eVwDY&t=399s
